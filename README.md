# Face-Recogntion-System

ML model with 80-85% accuracy which
recognizes the face. My role involved leveraging Python for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization. Firstly, we created
a data set by collecting a diverse range of facial images, then we utilized machine learning algorithms and techniques to train
the face recognition model. We experimented with different machine learning algorithms, to identify the most suitable
approach for our specific application. Finally, with a trained model in place, we implemented the face recognition system. By
successfully developing a face recognition system with 80 percent accuracy, we demonstrated our ability to handle complex
computer vision tasks and deliver practical solutions.
